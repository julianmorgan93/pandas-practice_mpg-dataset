🚗 MPG Dataset – Python Pandas Exercises

This repository contains data analysis exercises using the mpg.csv dataset and the pandas library in Python.

The mpg.csv dataset includes information about fuel economy, horsepower, cylinders, acceleration, and other attributes of cars from the 1970s–1980s. These exercises are designed to practice data wrangling, filtering, grouping, and exploratory analysis with pandas.

📂 Contents

mpg.csv – dataset containing car attributes
